This is a line from RStudio - ANNA WAS HERE

Adam's Summary: It was a struggle.

I wasnâ€™t connected to GitHub initially, so I had to manually add the repository to my project by copying and pasting the link. I also struggled to sync my work with my lab mates. Eventually, I realized that I needed to make changes, save, commit, push, and then pull in that order to avoid any issues.

Anna Summary: 
I first had to install github correctly. I did this by downloading a package. My next problem was that I had to configure my git ID. I did this by using my counsel and writing the commands "git config --global Anna" and "git config --afedie@iastate.edu". One last problem I had was when typing "This is a line from RSTUDIO". I fist had to save and commit my lines and then merge it together with Adam's and Grace's changes included. I did this by combining our lines and then Pushing the data out. Then lastly if someone else made changes I pulled it into the file.
