# Lab report #1

Follow the instructions posted at https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html for the lab assignment. The work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file to your repository.  

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for grading once the due date is passed.
Submit a link to your repository on Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that you are done with your submission.

Grace's Summary:
The first issue I faced was loading the package. I received assistance from Adam getting the README file loaded into my R Studio. Next, I had to configure my username and email into git, so I used my computers terminal to complete that task. Next, I faced a large issue with a log in disconnect between R Studio and Github. I had to delete my file and restart the instructions. After doing that, RStudio is still asking for my log in each time I push, but Github is updating properly, so I am acting like there is nothing wrong.

Adam's Summary: It was a struggle.

I wasnâ€™t connected to GitHub initially, so I had to manually add the repository to my project by copying and pasting the link. I also struggled to sync my work with my lab mates. Eventually, I realized that I needed to make changes, save, commit, push, and then pull in that order to avoid any issues.
